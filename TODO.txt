create a series of bad .torrent files to test N::B::Session with:
 - invalid pieces string
   + string length does not % 40 evenly
   + string is shorter than 40 chars
   + piece_length * num_pieces is nowhere near total_size_of_torrent
 - private .torrent
 - private .torrent without trackers should cause some sort of warning
